    <h1>Waffles Club</h1>
    <p>
      The waffle in Old Greece was a fundamental variant of flat cakes, which
      were produced by baking the cakes between two metal plates. Obelios, as
      these cakes were called, werenâ€™t especially sweet, but their design
      developed over time as people started customizing the food.
